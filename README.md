# AerofloraExpansion
Aeroflora Expansion: Immerse yourself in a tranquil experience where the ever-changing wind, adhering to the game jam's theme of "Wind" and "Constant Change" limitation, unpredictably influences the flight paths of balloons and the direction of seed dispersion. Players cultivate a vibrant landscape through the gentle art of balloon-spawning and seed-sowing, where the unpredictable wind adds a layer of dynamic strategy to the serene gameplay. The game also enchants with relaxing ambient farm sounds and adaptive wind sounds, enhancing immersion as they react to the wind's intensity and direction in-game. Embrace the fluidity of nature as the wind, visually represented by the windmill's rotation, becomes a pivotal element in achieving optimal balloon deployment and creating a flourishing landscape. \
Controls: \
Left Click on the barn to release balloons, and Left Click on each balloon to release seeds that blossom into lush flora upon descent, all while the wind's whimsical shifts challenge your planning skills. Navigate the environment with intuitive camera controls: left-click to move, scroll wheel to zoom, right-click, and middle-click to rotate around focal points.
